# Marketing-Chatbot

This Python project analyzes Amazon product reviews using natural language processing techniques to preprocess text data, compute TF-IDF vectorization, and apply linear regression to predict ratings based on text content. Additionally, it includes a functionality to find similar reviews using cosine similarity.

Installation
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. The required libraries can be installed via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Data Setup:

Place your Amazon reviews dataset named amazon.csv in the project root. The dataset should contain columns like review_content and rating.
Run Analysis:

Execute the main script to perform analysis:
bash
Copy code
python amazon_analysis.py
Results:

The script will output the Mean Squared Error of the regression model and print similar reviews for a predefined query.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Converts review texts to lowercase for uniformity.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforms text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
Linear Regression: Predicts ratings based on the processed text.
Cosine Similarity: Finds and displays reviews similar to a given query based on content similarity.
